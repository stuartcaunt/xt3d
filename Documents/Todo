DONE
====

x Intellij
x Use Float32Array and Matrix4 for KFUniform data
x Uniform: set value in GPU
x Global uniforms
x use haxe properties
x Event emitter
x Camera
x   Camera properties
x Geometry
x   VertexAttribute buffers
x StateManager
x MeshNode (Geometry and Material)
x update camera matrices if not added to the scene
x attribute state manager
x pass state managers to vertex data (remove singleton)
x get OpenGL doc offline
x custom attributes
x interleaved data
x store vertex attribute size, type (GL.Float, etc) in VertexData rather than separate maps
x handle ubyte color arrays
x update haxe, openfl, lime
x Int32Array indexes not working?
x verify/set float precisions in shaders
x textures
x   use state/texture manager for binding textures
x   don't create GLTexture immediately : wait until 'update' render phase
x   texture uniforms
x     automatically bind texture on material update
x   texture units ?
x     manual or automatic ?
x   unbind texture when deleted
x   non-pow2 images
x     need to modify UVs ?
x     three.js offsetRepeat uniform to dynamically scale/translate UVs
x   load from png
x   load from jpg
x   assets or url
x   load textures asynchronously and use callback to indicate that the data can be uploaded to gpu
x   different bit formats (8888, 4444)
x   from color
x handle "prepareForUse" in program uniforms
x verify blending (transparency)
x render order : group by geometries
x   group by materials?
x Primitives
x   plane
x   sphere
x material depth testing
x Performance
x   reuse Float32Array in Uniform.use
x   Try fixed size Float32Array for vertex data
x   Determine if array or matrix values are different (uniform.setMatrix)
x   verify inline getters/setters
x   remove some matrices sent to gpu : rejected since we test which matrices are needed
x Render texture
x   profile in iOS
x   improve demo
x   handle gl.clear better (states)
x   handle depth/stencil/color clear better and change resetFrameBuffer in renderer
x   figure out ios problem with stencil buffer
x   remove renderTexture.end
x   transparent bg clear color / general problem with opacity
x     Problem is that texture alpha = 0.0 (or value of alpha if we use bitmap data to create texture)
x   FrameBuffer/RenderBuffer Manager to avoid calling when no change occurs
x Architecture
x   remove passing textureManager/bufferManager etc : get from current director/renderer
x remove all singletons?
x   use "current" director
x schedule callbacks in nodes (update with dt)
x   Improve test with overloaded View
x lighting
x   Light class
x   Gather lights at beginning of render cycle and set global uniforms
x   shader extensions based on names
x     _texture, _phong, _etc
x   declare uniform types in shaderlib
x   uniform array types
x   uniform struct types
x   bool shader data type
x   GouraudShader (per vertex)
x   Lights as global uniforms
x     Add variables (including MAX_LIGHTS) to uniform lib (combine these with those in shader lib)
x     Add data types to uniform lib (combine these to those in shaderlib)
x     allow for uniform lib (common uniforms) to have array/struct types
x     Use common lighting uniforms in gouraud shader
x   Set lighting uniforms from scene lights
x   optimisation to setting lighting uniforms in Light
x   default values for uniform typedefs
x   Material colors/shininess
x   PhongShader (per pixel)

x director configuration options
x  shader precision
x  number of lights (MAX_LIGHTS)
x    verify number of lights doesn't exceed config value each frame
x  frame rate
x refactor XTExceptions
x Integration Lime GLContext / remove openfl dependencies
x   remove all openfl dependencies
x   set framerate : Application
x   set depth/stencil buffers :
x     ApplicationMain.config : antialiasing, depthbuffer, etc
x   remove openfl OpenGL view: use lime directly
x     openfl GLRenderer sets clearColor every frame and binds framebuffer every frame
x   listen to resize/frame_enter events
x limeGlView
x   get view rectangle/size
x   send gl to renderer
x   update renderer viewport only at init and during resize

x   gesture handler
x     Node : addChild, onAddedToScene, etc
x Camera
x   Camera controller
x Node:
x   onAddedToScene
x   onRemoveFromScene

x   render picking
x     16 bits for face ( each face = 3 elements) and 16 bit for object
x     render pass with id
x       specify objects that are rendered for specific id
x   face picking
x  - object picking
x Uniforms
x   int values
